To run it. Create a virtual enviornment called venv in root. Run the script start-services.sh and it should be working.

Install dependecies listed in each repo before running the script. 

Please in addition to that install Ollama and Gemma3:4b. You can do this with ollama pull gemma3:4b after you install ollama. 

There is also dockerfiles for each service if that's convenient.
